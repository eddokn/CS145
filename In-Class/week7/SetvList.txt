sets and lists
- does order matter
- are duplicates allowed

list - a collection of tings where order matters and duplicates are allowed
set - a collection of things where order doesn't matter and duplicates are not allowed

{carrot, egg, milk} == {egg, milk, carrot} -> true
{carrot, egg, milk, egg} -> not a set

Union - combine sets together and remove duplicates
{karna, andrea, mara, chris} U {mara, chris, lexy} = {karna, andrea, lexy}

Intersection - combine sets together, only take elements that are in common
{karna, andrea, mara, chris} intersect {mara, chris, lexy} = {mara, chris}
