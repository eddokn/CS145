//Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows 
//developers to manage complex systems by simplifying them into more manageable and 
//understandable components. It is crucial for several reasons:

//Encapsulation: Abstraction enables encapsulation, which is the bundling of data and the methods 
//that operate on that data into a single unit called an object. By hiding the internal implementation 
//details of an object and providing only the necessary information through well-defined interfaces, 
//abstraction protects the integrity and security of data and allows for modular and maintainable code.

//Simplification and complexity management: Abstraction helps manage complexity by focusing on the 
//essential features of an object and hiding unnecessary details. It allows developers to create 
//high-level representations of real-world objects or concepts, abstracting away the lower-level 
//implementation details. This simplifies the understanding, design, and maintenance of complex systems, 
//as developers can work with conceptual models that are closer to their mental models.

//Code reusability: Abstraction promotes code reusability. By creating abstract classes or interfaces 
//that define common behaviors and attributes, developers can define a set of methods that can be 
//shared among multiple concrete classes. This promotes the reuse of code, reduces duplication, 
//and facilitates modular programming.

//Flexibility and adaptability: Abstraction provides a level of flexibility and adaptability to 
//changing requirements. By designing systems based on abstract classes or interfaces, rather 
//than specific implementations, it becomes easier to introduce new functionalities or modify 
//existing ones without affecting other parts of the codebase. Clients of the abstract classes or 
//interfaces can remain unaffected as long as the defined contracts are maintained.

//Effective problem-solving: Abstraction allows developers to model real-world problems in a 
//way that closely aligns with the problem domain. By representing objects and their interactions 
//at a higher level of abstraction, developers can focus on solving domain-specific problems without 
//getting bogged down in implementation details. This helps in building more robust and maintainable solutions.
