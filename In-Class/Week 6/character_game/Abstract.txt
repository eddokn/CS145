what:
-special type of superclass, organize related classes
-can leave methods unimplemented by labeling them as abstract
-subclasses implement these methods in their own way
  -subclasses MUST implement the abstract methods it inherits
-cannot be instantiated


why
-a template reduces chances for bugs, makes codebase more readable,
maintainable and testable
-ensures that subclasses all have a certain set of methods
